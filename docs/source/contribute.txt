Source Code
-----------

``stl`` source code is available from the following git hosting
providers:

- `stl git repository <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=stl.git>`_
  (Cyborg Institute.)
- `stl on Github <https://github.com/cyborginstitute/stl/>`_

Feel free to clone or fork at your leisure. Issue a pull request on
GitHub or send me an email/IM/IRC message if you want to send a patch,
or would like me to pull from another repository changes back into
"maineline." I will accept patches of all sizes against both the
source and documentation.

Bugs/Issues
-----------

For the moment, I will track issues using the `Cyborg Institute
Listserv`_. Just write an email to the list with your issue or bug, or
send me a message directly and I'll start a new thread.

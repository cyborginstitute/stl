Overview
--------

``stl`` (i.e. "status logger") is a tool for managing, maintaining,
and logging work for writers. It provides a unified interface around
logging word count information, as well as compiling projects, and
other related functionality. If you publish text using software such
as `ikiwiki <http://ikiwiki.info/>`_, `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_, or using ad hoc Makefiles, ``stl`` may
be exactly the tool you need to:

- Record, manage, and view the output of your build tools (i.e. build
  reports.)

- Track word counts automatically to provide an overview of your
  progress both as you work and as you're attempting to track daily
  and hourly progress.

- Wrap your build tools to provide a more consistent interface.

The script and examples are written in `zsh <http://www.zsh.org/>`_ as
of early 2012, but may be rewritten in Python in the near future. In
many cases ``stl`` is useful as-is; however, this site provides an
in-depth over view over stl and suggestions for customizing and
extending its functionality to collect data and provide an interface
for *your* projects.

.. note::

   ``stl`` is one of those projects that works pretty well, but is
   difficult to maintain is not particularly flexible for a few
   reasonably systemic reasons. I'm presenting ``stl`` because I think
   personal logging and record keeping are valuable and I'm interested
   in developing more useful versions of ``stl`` in the
   future. --`tychoish <http://tychoish.com>`_

===================================
Internal Details and Implementation
===================================

Overview
--------

After experiencing trouble with the integrated approach of the
:doc:`zsh implementation </zsh>`, the current implementation takes a
more modular approach.

The two core components, :doc:`stl </internals/stl>` and :doc:`sauron
</internals/sauron>`, provide core functionality collecting data and
creating notifications respectively. The additional components,
:doc:`lnote </internals/lnote>` and :doc:`wc_track
</internals/wc_track>` wrap :doc:`stl </internals/stl>` and
:doc:`sauron </internals/sauron>` to provide more useful automatic
operation. In the case of :doc:`lnote </internals/lnote>`, to provide
a way of creating arbitrary log messages to annotate a status log: and
in the case of :doc:`wc_track </internals/wc_track>`, to provide a way
of automatically collecting word count data from a number of
pre-configured projects.

The documentation listed below provides an overview of the internal
implementation of each Python module, including code samples, with 
particular attention toward enhancement and future extension. For
usage information consider the :doc:`/use` documentation.
